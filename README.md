This project requires the latest version of python as well as the following libraries
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-learn
5. Jupyter Notebook



If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has most of the above packages and more included. Download anaconda from here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
